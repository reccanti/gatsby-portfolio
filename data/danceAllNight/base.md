headline: Dance All Night

I made this demo as part of the [Nightly Sea Creatures](http://codepen.io/collection/neJVwm/) CodePen Creative Challenge and it was later featured on CodePen's front page. One of the things I had been reading about at the time was web animation, and I wanted to try it out. I created the creature in Sketch and then exported it as a series of SVG componenets. To make it "dance" I animated it using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

Before my last year at RIT, I worked at Global Thinking from Summer through Fall. This was the biggest team I'd worked with up to that point: 8 people at its biggest. Communicating was a must, so I learned to regularly participate in dialy scrum meetings and code reviews to keep myself up-to-date. It was a big help in learning the stacks of the projects I was working on: a Laravel web application and Magento-based ecommerce platform.

I'm looking for ways to improve my art and design skills, and maybe get better at React while I'm at it. I read an article on smashing magazine that recommended trying to create a color scheme every day, so I decided to try it out for a bit.

This palette is inspired by what I've been watching recently. I've been rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho and have been in awe of the colors they use. In addition, I've been watching a lot of videos from the channel Artzie Music, which has a lot of looping images from cell-animated anime. I collected images from a lot of cell-animated anime series and put them in a Sketch file. Then, I tried to sample the most prominent colors from each of them, then tried to construct a color palatte from that, making some minor tweaks so that they work well together. I tried to use a complementary color scheme, with shades of blue contrasting with the red accent color.

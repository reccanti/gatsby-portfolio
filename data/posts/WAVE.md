I'm looking for ways to improve my art and design skills. I was reading an [article about color theory on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/) that suggested creating a color scheme every day, so I decided to try that out for a bit.

This palette is inspired by classic anime, when they still used cels. I've been rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho, and I've been impressed by it's bright and bold colors. In addition, I've been watching a lot of videos from the [Artzie Music YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/artziemusic), which often features music set to looping videos from different classic anime series.

To make this palette, I collected screenshots from these anime as I watched them and looked for similar images from other series online. I put these images in a Sketch file and sampled the most prominent colors from each of them. Once I had these colors, I started trying to combine them, making minor tweaks so that they worked well together. For this one, I tried to use a complementary scheme with shades of blue contrasting with the red accent color.

I started watching the UK version of _The Office_ this weekend, so I started making a color palette inspired by that. The method I used to get the base colors was similar to the one I used in my previous palettes, taking screenshots and compiling them into a Sketch document. Most of the colors that I got from these screenshots were overwhelmingly gray, which probably adds to the bleakness of the show.

The grayness of the palette was a good fit for the method I used to create it. I was reading [Rob Waychert's approach to making a color palette for his site](http://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/), and I wanted to try it out. I started by making a pure grayscale palette, and overlaying the colors on top of it.

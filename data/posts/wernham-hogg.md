I started watching the UK version of _The Office_ this weekend, so I made a color palette inspired by that. The method I used to get the base colors was similar to the one I used in my previous palettes: taking screenshots, compiling them into a Sketch document, picking notable colors out of them. I noticed that these colors were overwhelmingly gray, and I think that's part of what makes that show so bleak.

When it came to actually making the palette, I tried a new method. I was reading [Rob Waychert's approach to making a color palette for his site](http://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/), and I wanted to try it out. I started by making a grayscale palette with sufficient contrast between elements:

Then I arranged some of the colors I picked out in a similar way:

In my previous palettes, I tried to keep properties like _hue_ and _chroma_ similar, but I couldn't keep them exactly the same using the Sketch color picker. Eventually, I stumbled on a workaround: [blending modes](http://alistapart.com/article/blending-modes-demystified). 

Using the grayscale palette as a mask, I set different blending modes on different squares. The two on the left use _screen_, the three in the middle use _lighten_, and the one on the right uses _multiply_. The result of these two palettes combined is what you see below.

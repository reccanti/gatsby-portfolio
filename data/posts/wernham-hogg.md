I started watching the UK version of _The Office_ this weekend, so I started making a color palette inspired by that. The method I used to get the base colors was similar to the one I used in my previous palettes, taking screenshots and compiling them into a Sketch document. Most of the colors that I got from these screenshots were overwhelmingly gray, which probably adds to the bleakness of the show.

The grayness of the palette was a good fit for the method I used to create it. I was reading [Rob Waychert's approach to making a color palette for his site](http://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/), and I wanted to try it out. I started by making a grayscale palette with sufficient contrast between elements:

Then I made a palette of some of the colors I picked out and arranged them in a similar way:

In my previous palettes, I tried to keep properties like _hue_ and _chroma_ similar. I did this by eyeballing it in the Sketch color picker, but I wanted something more exact, and I found out I could get that by using [blending modes](http://alistapart.com/article/blending-modes-demystified). I set the grayscale palette to be a mask and assigned different blending modes to each of the squares. The first two on the left used _screen_, the middle three used _lighten_ and the last one on the right used _multiply_. The result was this palette:

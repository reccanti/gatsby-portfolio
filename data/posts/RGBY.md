That's right, who said these all had to be 5-color palettes? This palette came from some of the other colors that I collected for WAVE.

One of the things I tried playing around with was _hue_ and _chroma_. A good explanation of these can be found in [Color Theory for Designers â€“ Part 2](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designers-part-2-understanding-concepts-and-terminology/) on Smashing Magazine. For the three greens, I tried to keep the hue similar, but I adjusted the chroma, making them darker or lighter. For 3 accent colors, I tried to keep the chroma the same, but I adjusted the hues.

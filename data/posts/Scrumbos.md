This palette is pretty much an excuse to talk about _Goodbye Forever Party_. It's a short animated film by the creator of _Rachel and Her Grandfather Control the Island_, which I also enjoyed. Goodbye Forever Party is a story about a person dealing with depression with some dark comedy mixed in. It's not the kind of thing I usually look for, but this one really stuck with me. In addition, the creator posted a making-of video, and the amount of craft and work that went into it really inspired me to work on my own art.

This palette uses four colors, one for each Scrumbo. To balance it out, I added a dark gray, which was based on the pencil that was used for most of the film.

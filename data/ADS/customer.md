Over the Summer of my Junior year of college, I worked on the Administrative Data System, a program that faculty of the Interactive Games and Media program could use to manage student records. My job involved working on a team of four to implement new pages and features for these faculty members, and to improve and standardize existing features. In addition, I also had to research software that could be used for new features.

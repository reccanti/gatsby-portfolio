One of my issues I had on this project was that I got really focused on one aspect, the interactive query builder, but wasn't able to completely follow through on it. I struggled for a while on that feature, but ended up making very little progress as it grew more complex. I did get some experience interacting with makers of an open-source project, though.

Another regret I had is that I didn't talk to the faculty all that much when I was developing features. It seemed like we did all right and they were satisfied with the software, but it would have been a great opportunity to work more directly with the client.

During the Summer of my Junior year of college, I joined a small team of students working on the Administrative Data System (ADS), a tool designed to help faculty at RIT manage student records. My job was to develop new features and pages that the faculty requested, and to standardize existing components into a form that could be reused by the rest of the team. I also researched proprietary and open-source software to use for a SQL query builder.

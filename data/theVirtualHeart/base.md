headline: The Virtual Heart

The Virtual Heart was a website maintained by the Rochester Institute of Technology's College of Science that illustrated how the heart works using interactive graphics.  Many of these were written as Java Applets and had to be ported to JavaScript.  This proved challenging.  Most of the graphics involved processing large amounts of data, which forced me to consider performance when writing code.  

Along the way, I also set out to prepare the site for future updates: getting it on version control, organizing a git-centered workflow, and setting up an organization on GitHub that future maintainers could join.

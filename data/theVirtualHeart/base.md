headline: Updating The Virtual Heart
---

The Virtual Heart was a website maintained by the College of Science at RIT that showed information about how the heart works with interactive graphics to illustrate certain concepts. Many of these were written as Java Applets, and my job was to port them to JavaScript. This proved challenging, as the graphics involved processing large amounts of data, and it really forced me to consider performance when writing code. Along the way, I also set out to prepare the site for future updates: getting it on version control, organizing a git-centered workflow, and setting up an organization on GitHub that future maintainers could join.

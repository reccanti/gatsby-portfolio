Swipe Rogue was a project I worked on as the lead developer during my last semester at RIT. The goal of the project was to create a mobile game that was distilled a [Rogue-like](insert wikipedia link here) game into a form that could be enjoyed on mobile devices.

We only had one semester to work on the project, about 16 weeks. Even though we had the initial concept, we spent the first couple of weeks doing research, comparing it to other Rogue-inspired games like *The Binding of Isaac* and to other mobile games like *Tiny Dice Dungeon*. This allowed us to get a feel for how certain features could be adapted for the shift in platform.

Once we started development, we made sure to test as soon as possible. We started by testing on devices on our own, making sure that the gameplay mechanics we were developing on our computers worked just as well when transferred to a device. During Spring Break, we also organized a field test and gathered feedback that we could use to refine the product.

This class was just the first step of an iterative process. The goal was to be able to produce a prototype by the end of the semester. The goal was ultimately to keep refining the product through subsequent semesters. At the end of semester, I was able to prepare and document the work in such a way that a new group could take it over.

During my last semester at RIT, I wanted to work on a project that I could see from the beginning to it's final stages. The result of that was Swipe Rogue, a mobile game for Android and iOS. For 16 weeks, I worked as the lead developer on a team with two other people to create a prototype from scratch.

The goal of the project was to bring the experience of a Rogue-like game, one traditionally played on a computer terminal, to mobile devices. Though we came into the project with an initial idea, we were mostly working from scratch. Before writing any code, we spent the first couple of weeks heads down, just doing research. During this time, we compared it to similar rogue-inspired games like *The Binding of Isaac*, as well as to otherwise unrelated mobile games like *Tiny Dice Dungeon*. We also made note of the features that we wanted and estimated what we thought we could reasonably accomplish in that time frame. From that, we were able to create a plan to implement the best prototype we could.

In order to accomplish our goals for this project, we had to be able to quickly iterate and communicate. The project was divided into features that me and the other developer could work on independently. We used Git to manage our code and GitHub to host it so that we could easily access our changes remotely. We also created a Discord server so that we could organize remote meetings over voice chat and quickly get updates on features or assets that we needed.

Another important aspect of this development was testing. We couldn't afford to get too far in development, only to find out that it didn't work properly on devices, so we began building for devices as soon as possible. We also organized a field test during Spring Break, so that we could see which features were working, and which needed to be improved. At the end of the process we prepared a prototype on several Android and iOS devices that we were able to let people play.

headline: "Mobile Game Swipe Rogue"
---
Swipe Rogue was mobile game for iOS and Android. The goal of the game was to distill the core mechanic of a [Rogue-like](insert wikipedia link here) into a form that could be more easily enjoyed on a mobile device. To achieve this goal, me and two other students formed a team to make a protoype by the end of the semester. I was the lead developer on the project, which involved a lot of technical work, as well as a lot of social work. I had to break the initial concept down into smaller requirements which could then be shared with my other teammates. Development was handled by me and one other teammate, which meant that I had to plan how to split the requirements between us in a way that we wouldn't block each other or create conflicts. We also had one person working on the design, which required me to outline what designs were needed at each stage, and coming up with plans on how to prepare them in such a way that they could easily be used in the engine. This required explaining exactly what was needed and why they needed to be a specific way. At the end of the semester, we were able to preview the project to the class on both Android and iOS devices.

headline: "Mobile Game Swipe Rogue"

Swipe Rogue was a mobile game for iOS and Android using the Unity game engine. The goal of the project was to distill the experience of a [Rogue-like](insert wikipedia link here) game into something that could be enjoyed on mobile devices. I acted as the lead developer in a team of three, and as such was responsible for making technology decisions.

I initially wanted to make the project in iOS using SpriteKit, but Unity ended up being the better choice. Our team already had some experience developing with Unity, and we were  split between Mac and PC users. Unity would allow us to quickly build features on both platforms, and it also allowed us to build it for both iOS and Android. 

To develop this project, we had to make ensure that we all stayed up-to-date with each other's progress without stepping on each other's toes. We found the best way to do this was to break up the project into discrete features that could be worked on independently. We used Git for version control, developing our features on separate feature branches. The code was hosted on GitHub so that we could easily share code remotely. Because Unity Scenes don't always work well with Git, we developed a strategy of developing features in separate "test scenes", only adding the components to the main scene when the feature was finished.

At the end of the semester, we were able to show our prototype to the class on both Android and iOS devices.

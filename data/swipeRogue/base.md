Swipe Rogue is a mobile game made for Android and iOS in Unity. It was made as part of a Production Studio class, where students were encouraged to form groups and work on their own projects over the course of a semester. I came up with the initial concept of the game and was the lead developer. As the lead developer, I was directly responsible for implementing features like random maze generation and enemy behavior. I was also responsible for maintaining the iOS build of the project and plotting the overall architecture.

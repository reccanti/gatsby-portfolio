headline: "Swipe Rogue"
---

During my last semester at RIT, I wanted to break out of my comfort zone of web development and explore mobile development, so I pitched an idea for a game that I could make as part of a Production Studio class. That idea became Swipe Rogue, a simple game where players try to quickly explore a temple floor-by-floor, fighting enemies and collecting treasure along the way. It was made for Android and iOS devices using the Unity game engine. I was the lead developer for the prototype, which I  made alongside two other students over the course of a semester.

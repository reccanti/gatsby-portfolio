headline: "Swipe Rogue"

During my last semester at RIT, I wanted explore something other than web development, so I decided to try making a mobile game. The result was Swipe Rogue, a simple game where players tried to quickly explore a temple floor-by-floor, fighting enemies and collecting treasure along the way. It was made for Android and iOS devices using the Unity game engine.  I was the lead developer on the project, which I worked on with two other students over the course of a semester.

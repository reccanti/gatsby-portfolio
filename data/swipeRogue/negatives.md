For my last semester at RIT, I took a production studio class because I wanted to work with a group on a project and see it through to completion. It was a lofty goal and one that I wasn't quite able to accomplish, but I definitely learned a lot about process and produced a great prototype. 

One issue that we had was with organization. We organized weekly meetings over Discord and submitted weekly progress reports, however we weren't able to get the process down to a level that felt natural. Looking back, I would have tried to push for a more organized Scrum process, one with at least daily check-ins on Discord so that we could keep track of our weekly goals.

Another issue that we had was with version control. I knew going in that Unity didn't work very well with Git, but they were the only tools that the rest of the team was familiar with, so we went ahead anyway. For the most part, we did pretty well with the setup we had. We organized a method of testing out features in separate scenes that we would only work on on our local machines, but by that point we had alread started to develop issues that were never quite resolved. 

There were also issues with accountability. One of our developers was having trouble getting work done on time. It wasn't too bad at first, but as the semester went on, it started to become an issue, and I didn't do a good job confronting the issue or finding a way to work with him on that.

We also ran into some issues communicating our requirements to our designer. I was planning on rendering the screen with tiles, but I hadn't communicated that with the designer, and as a result we had to work with a large floor and some uneven tiles.

Finally, we used playtests and field tests to get some feedback, but they weren't very organized. We should have gone into them with more planning, so that we could write down specifically what we were looking for going in and, and we didn't have anything formally written down afterwards.

All in all, we produced a prototype that I'm very proud of and we were successful in showing it off at the end of the semester. There were some things I would have done differently looking back on it, though.

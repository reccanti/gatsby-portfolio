This was another CodePen Creative Challenge: [Rainbow Text Weekend](http://codepen.io/collection/nxKPzY/). With this one, I wanted to experiment with some of the more advanced features of Sass. The letters are just divs. They have different background colors and different transition delays, but are otherwise similar. To make use of this, I created a map of colors and their values, then iterated over each of them to generate each of the classes.

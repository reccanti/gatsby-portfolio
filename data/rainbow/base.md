This was from another CodePen Creative Challenge: [Rainbow Text Weekend](http://codepen.io/collection/nxKPzY/). With this one, I wanted to experiment with some of the more advanced features of Sass. Though the letters had different background colors and transition delays, everything else could be reused. I made a map of colors and their values, then iterated over them to generate the class for each letter.

My introduction to PHP came in the Summer and Fall of my Junior year when I worked on a web application for the Interactive Games and Media program at RIT. Having had previously done back-end development at Cathedral Corporation, I found a lot of the skills I learned from that carried over. That being said, there was a lot of new things to discover. Part of my job required me to research existing technology that we could integrate into the app, which exposed me to a lot of new and interesting frameworks. It was also the first app I worked on that made use of AJAX through jQuery, which was interesting to wrap my head around. Finally, it was the first time I worked on a serious existing application with a team, this one being 4 people, so I had to be aware of what everyone else was doing and make my code consistent. In a lot of ways, it was the next level up from what I was doing at Cathedral, still doing back-end development on web applications, but with more independence and more people.

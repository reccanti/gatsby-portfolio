My first programming job was making a web application at Cathedral Corporation. It was my first time making an application that needed to be used by other people, and wasn't just something I was playing around with. I was doing basic front-end development before this, but this job exposed me to the whole stack of web development. Under the supervision of the lead developer, I designed front-end and back-end architecture in Classic ASP and ASP.NET, retrieving data from a SQL Server and protecting the front-end from Cross-site scripting.

I worked at Cathedral Corporation on a co-op, and it was my first programming job. While there, I was exposed to both back-end and front-end web development through Classic ASP and ASP.NET. However, the biggest take-away was that it was my first time developing software according to client requirements. Under the supervision of the lead programmer, I built a web-application for them to manage their mailing campaigns. By the end of that Summer, I learned a great deal about developing software in the real world.

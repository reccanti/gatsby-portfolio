Looking back, I don't know if I fully appreciated this co-op. I was essentially doing all the work of a real job despite having very little experience. I think I rose to the challenge of tackling the full stack, but I feel like I could have taken more initiative in learning other things. I remember thinking about how all I wanted to work on was the front-end, but now I'm much more interested in learning about the full stack.

I think another thing that I could have taken more advantage of was the non-technical portions of the job. Though I was just an intern, I wish I had taken more interest and initiative when it came to taking part in meetings and discussing design decisions. I also wish I had formed a better relationship with my coworkers.

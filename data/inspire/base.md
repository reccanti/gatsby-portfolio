For my capstone project, RIT teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to create new exhibits for the museum. My group created Inspire, an installation that allowed people to discover music together. Users could select artists they enjoyed from a touch display, which would be sent to Spotify's Echonest API to get a similar artist.  After that, we would download assets related to that artist, create a short video according to a template we designed, and project it onto a multi-faced spire. I was the lead developer on this project, where I acted as a bridge between the developers and designers and ensured that all the different components of the project worked well together.

For my capstone project, the New Media departments at RIT teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to create new exhibits for the museum. My group created Inspire, an installation that used projection mapping and several music APIs to allow people to discover music together. People would select artists they enjoyed from a touch display and we would find a similar artist using Spotify's Echonest API. Then, we would use that information to get enough assets to create a short video that would be projected onto a multi-faced spire. I was the lead developer on this project, where I acted as a bridge between the developer and design teams and ensured that all of different facets of the project worked well together.

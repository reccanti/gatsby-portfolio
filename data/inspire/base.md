headline: "Projection Mapping Display: Inspire"
---
Inspire was a projection mapping installation for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the New Media Team Project. Dynamically created audiovisual displays based on musical artists selected by the user(s). Worked as the lead developer to manage a team of developers in conjunction with a team of designers to plan out the projeect and present it at imagineRIT. In planning this project, I also worked on a team to help raise funding, exceeding our goals, using the USEED crowdfunding platform

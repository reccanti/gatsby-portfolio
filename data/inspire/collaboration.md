headline: "Projection Mapping Display: Inspire"

For my capstone project, the New Media departments of RIT teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to create new installations for the museum. My group wanted to create an exhibit that allowed people to discover music together, and the result was InSpire. The project made use of projection mapping and several music APIs. I acted as the lead developer, and I was responsible for coordinating the developers as they worked on all of these pieces, and working with design to implement their work in a way that would work best with the technology we had, as well as a healthy bit of fundraising.

The first thing I did once we had broken down our requirements was find a way to divide them into discrete components that each of the developers could work on relatively independently. Design was made aware of who was working on each section, so they knew who to talk to when they needed to bring something up.

That being said, I also worked with my developers to help them with what they were working on and help make the different parts of the codebase communicate with each other across different machines. 

Presenting the project at RIT was also a team effort. The installation we made was big, and required the whole team to set up and maintain throughout the day. At the end of the day, though, our project was a success.

While I'm ultimately proud of what we accomplished with InSpire, I feel like there's a few things I didn't handle well and would do differently next time.

Another thing that went wrong was loose requirements. It took a very long time to figure out what our exhibit would even look like, and when we did our requirements weren't very well defined. We had a lot of ideas that we weren't able to plan for entirely during development, so we ended up having to cut a lot of it out.

Another thing I would do differently looking back would be more integration testing. We didn't end up testing and setting up the whole project together until the very end. We tested each of the components separately, and together, but not on the final devices, but there was a lot that ended up falling through the cracks.

One of the things that feels like a missed opportunity was how I handled working as a group. After having a couple of jobs where I worked as part of a team, it's nice being able to have someone who you can call up to ask about something. In college, there's a lot of work for different classes to do, and it's tempting to want to just work on your own stuff in your own place on your own time, but it doesn't help you stay up-to-date with your team and it doesn't help with bonding. Were I to go back, I would probably push for working in a group more.

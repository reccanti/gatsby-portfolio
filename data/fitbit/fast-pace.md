Fitbit is currently the largest company I've worked at, and also the most fast-paced. As a Digital Marketing Engineer, I work as part of a small team to develop pages for marketing campaigns. We used a strict Scrum methodology to complete this work while coordinating with the different departments (creative, copywriting, etc...), having daily meetings as well as review, retrospectives and estimation meetings. My job is primarily on the front-end, developing and updating pages using a Metalsmith build system and JSP.

Over the course of my career, my team size has grown. My current job is no exception. At Fitbit, I work with about 6 developers and qa testers, but the organization around it is much larger. Alongside my team, I work to develop product and store pages for marketing campaigns, but I frequently interact with designers, copywriters, project managers, and more. Using scrum, we coordinate to develop pages in time for specific marketing campaigns.

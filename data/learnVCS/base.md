learnVCS was a website that illustrated version control concepts for students of RIT's Department of Interactive Games and Media. It described the problems that version control solves and demonstrated best practices with a graph that displayed GitHub repositories.  It also had links to other resources that students could use to learn about specific version control systems in depth. I worked as the designer for the site with two developers. I created the initial design and assets using Sketch and helped to implement the designs using SCSS.

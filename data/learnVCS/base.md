learnVCS was a website that was made to illustrate version control concepts to students at RIT's Department of Interactive Games and Meda. It describes the problems that version control solves and illustrates them using a graph that displays GitHub repositories. It also contains links to resources that students can use to learn about specific version control systems in depth. I worked as the designer for the site alongside two developers and created the initial design using Sketch and updating it as new requirements were added. I also helped implement the designs using SCSS.

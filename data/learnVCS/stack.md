Learning to use version control is a crucial part of functioning on a team of developers. At school, we noticed that it was expected for us to learn how to use version control software, but we didn't have a good resource for actually learning it. To fix this, me and two other students teamed up to produce a resource that could be used within our program as part of an independent study. I worked as the designer on this project, which had its share of challenges. I had to compress a multitude of version control information and resources into an easily digestible site. I was also working closely with the developers, though, doing a share of the development myself, so I also had to tailor my designs in such a way that they were easy to work with.

headline: website learnVCS

Looking back, the project is very unfocused. It's titled learnVCS, but it opens with an interactive diagram that doesn't really expain what version control is. I would find a way to lead with the version control resources and incorporate the interactive diagram into other aspects

There's still a lot of bugs in the page that we never got around to fixing. It would have been great to go back and fix them.

For a simple page, we relied very heavily on BEM notation for creating components and sections. It may have provided a helpful structure for us as less experience developers, but looking forward I would not rely on it for something as simple as this.
